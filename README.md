# AI-Powered-Video-Archive
Using  NLP  we have created an AI-powered video archive that can be used to search for videos identify objects and people in videos, and understand the text that is spoken in videos
In this directory there are notebooks and scripts that demo how we built the YouTube Search App.

00-data-build.ipynb shows how we used the Kaggle YTTTS dataset with Beautiful Soup and other libraries to create the data used in the app. 

01-yt-search.ipynb demonstrates the indexing and querying used to populate and query the index. 

app.py is the Streamlit script powering the app itself.
